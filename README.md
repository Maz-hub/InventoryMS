# Inventory Management System

This project is divided into two parts: Backend and Frontend.

- Backend: Focuses on server setup and database management. Django is used for handling the backend, with the help of [django-crispy-forms](https://django-crispy-forms.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html#installing-django-crispy-forms) to manage forms in a clean and elegant way.
- Frontend: Utilizes [crispy-bootstrap5](https://pypi.org/project/crispy-bootstrap5/), an extension of django-crispy-forms, to seamlessly integrate Bootstrap 5 styling into Django forms for a polished and responsive user interface.
